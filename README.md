## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and Install dependencies

```
$ yarn
```

Run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ yarn test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to start the API:

```
$ yarn json-server server.json -p 3333
```

Then run the app in a local server:

```
$ yarn start
```

To build the production version run:

```
$ yarn build
```
